It will allow the company to identify the location of its main competitor KFC and where to locate its potential new store where there will be considerable foot traffic\n\nFried chicken is very popular in Japan, so much so that  its a christmas tradition to dine at a KFC restaurant on christmas\n\nProblem to Solve:\n\nThe major purpose of this project, is to suggest potential good locations to open their first store in Japan . \n\n## The Location:\nThe location will be shibuya since it is one of the most crowded places in all of tokyo, with the epicenter being shibuya crossing the most crowded street in the world \n\n## Foursquare API:\nThis project will utilize the Four-square API in order to collect the primary location data in the area as it has the largest database that is constanly updated and offers details about the businesses.\n\n## Clustering Approach:\nwe will try to cluster the areas in Tokyo around shibuya based on competitor density and potential area for increased foot traffic. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm\n\n## Libraries Used for the Project:\n\nPandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.\nFolium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map.\nScikit Learn: For importing k-means clustering.\nJSON: Library to handle JSON files.\nXML: To separate data from presentation and XML stores data in plain text format.\nGeocoder: To potentially  retrieve Location Data.\nBeautiful Soup and Requests: To potentially scrap and library to handle http requests.\nMatplotlib: Python Plotting Module.\n\n## Data:\n\nWe will need data about different venues in different neighborhoods around Shibuya. In order to gain that information we will use \"Foursquare\" locational information. Foursquare is a location data provider with information about a variety of venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. As such, the foursquare location platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API.\n\nAfter choosing the Shibuya , we then connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighborhood. For each neighborhood, we have chosen the radius to be 100 meter.\n\nThe data retrieved from Foursquare contained information of venues within a specified distance of the longitude and latitude of the postcodes. The information obtained per venue as follows:\n\n1. Neighborhood\n2. Neighborhood Latitude\n3. Neighborhood Longitude\n4. Venue\n5. Name of the venue e.g. the name of a store or restaurant\n6. Venue Latitude\n7. Venue Longitude\n8.
